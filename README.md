# Sandwich Shop App

A Flutter application for ordering sandwiches with customizable options.

## Features

- Select sandwich type: **six-inch** or **footlong**
- Choose bread type: **white**, **wheat**, or **wholemeal**
- Add a custom note to your order (e.g., "no onions")
- Increase or decrease the quantity of sandwiches (up to a configurable maximum)
- Visual display of your current order, including bread type, sandwich type, quantity, and notes
- Modern UI using Flutter's Material Design

## Project Structure

## How It Works

- The main screen lets users select sandwich size and bread type using a switch and dropdown menu.
- Users can add notes for special requests.
- Quantity is managed with add/remove buttons, limited by a maximum value.
- The current order is displayed with sandwich icons and details.
